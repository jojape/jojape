### Hey 👋 ,

I'm Jorge Jaramillo, a software engineer from Valencia (Spain) that ended up living in Berlin. I first came for an internship at [Tandem](https://tandem.net/) and here I am: 4 winters old. I currently work at Wunderflats, where we are enabling people to live anywhere anytime. Wunderflats is a marketplace for furnished apartments. It just lets you rent long term apartments online. I am mostly using js to solve all the challenges that come, and of course I build tiny shell scripts to make my life easier. I used to solve problems in the past in Java, PHP, MySQL... but at [Zenjob](https://github.com/zenjob) I had the chance to really get my hands on js and I fall in love 💜 .
